# Ignoring certificates
There may be certificates that you are aware have expired and therefore don't want the certificate checker to flag. To ignore you these certificates do the following:

Create a new file called `certificate_allowlist.config`
To add a certificate that you want to ignore, you can either include the path to the certificate if it is a file e.g `./work/test.yml`
Or include the base64 encoded string of the certificate e.g `LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tL......`

An example of `certificate_allowlist.config`
```
LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tL......
./work/test.yml
```

The expired cert checker should pickup `certificate_allowlist.config` within a directory by default but you can explicitly add it to the command line argument using `expired-cert-finder --expired-cert-list-filename=./certificate_allowlist.config`

# Developers

Development dependencies are stored within `requirements_dev.txt`, you can install them after you have installed the normal `requirements.txt`.

This can be done using `pip install -r requirements.txt` then `pip install -re requirements_dev.txt`

## Testing

Testing is carried out by the Behave framework which can be executed by using the command `behave`.

The current set of tests are written as Cucumber Scenarios, which are stored within the `features` directory.

When the tests are run they create a working directory called `./work`.
